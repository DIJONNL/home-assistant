# This automation turns on the light when there is motion in the bathroom
# Light is only enabled based on sunset / sunrise conditions (replace with a sensor)

trigger:
- platform: state
  entity_id: binary_sensor.0xec1bbdfffeaf9cf0_occupancy
  to: 'on'
condition:
  #OR statement looks strange but is correct https://home-assistant.io/docs/scripts/conditions/#or-condition
  #Using "before: sunset" and "after: sunrise" causes light to come on when arriving during the day.
  #"after_offset:" appears to have to be used with "after:" and "before_offset:" appears to have to be used with "before:" since the trigger doesn't fire correctly using "after: ... before_offset: ..." or "before: ... after_offset: ..." in my experience. Positive or negative offset values only seem to matter on the after_offset (but produce the same outcomes for the before_offset).
  condition: or
  conditions:
    - condition: sun
      after: sunset
      after_offset: "-01:30:00"

      before: sunrise
